## Investment Process

### 1. Morning Dashboard Review
Every morning begins with the **live web dashboard** for real-time portfolio and macro context:

**Web Dashboard** (Primary):
- Open browser to dashboard URL
- Review Palmer's regime analysis and traffic lights
- Check Monte Carlo 6-month forecast
- Review position-level theories and P&L attribution
- Monitor today's economic releases

**CLI Research** (Deep Dive):
```bash
lox dashboard                    # Unified view: inflation, growth, liquidity, vol
lox labs rates snapshot --llm    # PhD-level rates/curve analysis
lox labs vol --llm               # Volatility regime with scenario probabilities
```

The dashboard surfaces:
- **Portfolio Health**: NAV, unrealized P&L, cash available
- **Performance Attribution**: Fund return vs S&P 500 and BTC with alpha
- **Regime Status**: Real-time classification (RISK-ON/CAUTIOUS/RISK-OFF)
- **Volatility Context**: VIX level with percentile and regime implications
- **Credit Conditions**: HY spreads with stress indicators
- **Rates Environment**: 10Y yield with historical context
- **Economic Calendar**: Today's releases with actual vs estimate
- **Portfolio News**: Position-relevant headlines

### 2. Deep Research
Before any trade, I conduct multi-source analysis:

```bash
lox labs commodities snapshot --llm   # Oil, gold, copper with news synthesis
lox labs growth snapshot --llm        # Employment trends with probability scenarios
lox monetary fedfunds-outlook         # Fed policy outlook with historical analogs
```

Each `--llm` report provides:
- **Probability-weighted scenarios** (Bull/Base/Bear with specific targets)
- **Event-driven catalyst calendar** (impact estimates for upcoming releases)
- **Cross-asset trade expressions** (sector ETFs, not just the obvious plays)
- **Historical analogs** with what's different this time
- **News synthesis** with source citations

### 3. Idea Generation
The platform generates trade ideas as **starting points for analysis**, not execution signals:

```bash
lox suggest --style defensive    # Ideas aligned to risk posture
lox labs hedge                   # Portfolio-aware defensive ideas
lox labs grow                    # Regime-aligned offensive ideas
```

Every idea is evaluated against:
- Current portfolio Greeks and exposures
- Regime alignment and conviction level
- Risk/reward with explicit targets and stops

### 4. Risk Analysis
Before execution, stress-test the portfolio:

```bash
lox labs mc-v01 --regime RISK_OFF --real    # Crash scenario (-25% drift)
lox labs mc-v01 --regime VOL_CRUSH --real   # Hedge drag scenario
lox labs mc-v01 --regime SLOW_BLEED --real  # Death by 1000 cuts
lox analyze --depth deep                     # Full position analysis
```

### 5. Execution Decision
After completing research, I make the final call:
- Size based on conviction and portfolio impact
- Entry triggers based on technical/catalyst timing
- Stops and targets informed by scenario analysis

**No trade is executed without completing this workflow.**

## Strategy

### Mandate
Discretionary macro portfolio management with systematic research support. Primary focus on tail-risk hedging with positive carry during calm periods.

### Thesis
- Persistent inflation risk above 2010s baseline
- Rising macro volatility from fiscal/rates dynamics
- Structural shift in Treasury issuance → higher vol premium
- Regime awareness improves timing and sizing

### Implementation
- **Long convexity**: OTM puts on SPY/QQQ, VIX calls
- **Delta management**: Adjust exposures based on regime signals
- **Carry optimization**: Time spreads and premium selling in favorable regimes
- **Cross-asset**: Sector rotation based on rate/vol/growth implications

### Risk Limits
| Metric | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Max position size | 15% NAV |
| Max portfolio delta | ±30% |
| Max theta decay | 2% NAV/month |
| VaR 95% (3M) | <10% |

## Data Sources

| Source | Data |
