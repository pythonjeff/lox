## Investment Process

### 1. Morning Dashboard Review
Every morning begins with the **live web dashboard** for real-time portfolio and macro context:

**Web Dashboard** (Primary):
- Open browser to dashboard URL
- Review Palmer's regime analysis and traffic lights
- Check Monte Carlo 6-month forecast
- Review position-level theories and P&L attribution
- Monitor today's economic releases

**CLI Research** (Deep Dive):
```bash
lox dashboard                    # Unified view: inflation, growth, liquidity, vol
lox labs rates snapshot --llm    # PhD-level rates/curve analysis
lox labs vol --llm               # Volatility regime with scenario probabilities
```

The dashboard surfaces:
- **Portfolio Health**: NAV, unrealized P&L, cash available
- **Performance Attribution**: Fund return vs S&P 500 and BTC with alpha
- **Regime Status**: Real-time classification (RISK-ON/CAUTIOUS/RISK-OFF)
- **Volatility Context**: VIX level with percentile and regime implications
- **Credit Conditions**: HY spreads with stress indicators
- **Rates Environment**: 10Y yield with historical context
- **Economic Calendar**: Today's releases with actual vs estimate
- **Portfolio News**: Position-relevant headlines

### 2. Deep Research
Before any trade, I conduct multi-source analysis:

**Ticker-Level Research** (Primary):
```bash
lox labs ticker deep -t FXI --llm     # Full ETF analysis: holdings, flows, institutional holders
lox labs ticker deep -t AAPL --llm    # Full stock analysis: earnings, estimates, SEC filings
lox chat -t FXI                        # Interactive discussion with research context loaded
```

**Macro Research**:
```bash
lox labs commodities snapshot --llm   # Oil, gold, copper with news synthesis
lox labs growth snapshot --llm        # Employment trends with probability scenarios
lox monetary fedfunds-outlook         # Fed policy outlook with historical analogs
```

Each `--llm` report provides:
- **Probability-weighted scenarios** (Bull/Base/Bear with specific targets)
- **Event-driven catalyst calendar** (impact estimates for upcoming releases)
- **Cross-asset trade expressions** (sector ETFs, not just the obvious plays)
- **Historical analogs** with what's different this time
- **News synthesis** with source citations

### 3. Idea Generation
The platform generates trade ideas as **starting points for analysis**, not execution signals:

```bash
lox suggest --style defensive    # Ideas aligned to risk posture
lox labs hedge                   # Portfolio-aware defensive ideas
lox labs grow                    # Regime-aligned offensive ideas
```

Every idea is evaluated against:
- Current portfolio Greeks and exposures
- Regime alignment and conviction level
- Risk/reward with explicit targets and stops

### 4. Risk Analysis
Before execution, stress-test the portfolio:

```bash
lox labs mc-v01 --regime RISK_OFF --real    # Crash scenario (-25% drift)
lox labs mc-v01 --regime VOL_CRUSH --real   # Hedge drag scenario
lox labs mc-v01 --regime SLOW_BLEED --real  # Death by 1000 cuts
lox analyze --depth deep                     # Full position analysis
```

### 5. Execution Decision
After completing research, I make the final call:
- Size based on conviction and portfolio impact
- Entry triggers based on technical/catalyst timing
- Stops and targets informed by scenario analysis

**No trade is executed without completing this workflow.**

lox labs ticker deep -t FXI --llm    # China large-cap ETF
lox labs ticker deep -t TIP --llm    # TIPS bond ETF
```
- **Fund Profile**: AUM, expense ratio, holdings count, category
- **Top Holdings**: Asset breakdown with weights (uses `name` fallback for bond holdings)
- **Performance & Flows**: 1W, 1M, 3M, YTD returns + fund flow signals (volume trend proxy for inflows/outflows)
- **Institutional Holders**: Top 10 investors with share counts and position changes (who's buying/selling)
- **LLM Analysis**: Fund thesis, holdings concentration, risk factors, market environment fit

**Stock Analysis Features**
```bash
lox labs ticker deep -t AAPL --llm   # Individual stock
lox labs ticker deep -t NVDA --llm   # Growth stock
```
- **Company Profile**: Sector, industry, market cap, description
- **Price & Technicals**: Current price, day/52-week ranges, volume analysis
- **Hedge Fund Metrics**: P/E, P/S, P/B, EV/EBITDA, ROE, ROIC, margins, FCF yield
- **Earnings & Estimates**: Next earnings date, analyst EPS/revenue estimates, historical beat rate
- **SEC Filings**: Recent 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q with items/descriptions
- **Analyst Targets**: Consensus, low, high price targets with analyst count
- **LLM Analysis**: Bull/bear case, earnings preview, near-term catalysts

**Interactive Ticker Chat**
```bash
lox chat -t AAPL    # Chat with AAPL context loaded
lox chat -t FXI     # Discuss China ETF with full research context
```
Loads deep research data (profile, earnings, news, SEC filings) into chat for focused ticker discussions.

**Example Output: ETF Institutional Holders**
```
                     Top Institutional Holders

This research forms the foundation for every trade decision — understanding who's investing, what the fund/company does, and how it fits our macro thesis.

### v2 Regime System (January 25, 2026)

**Unified Regime Framework**
- **10 Regime Domains**: Macro, Volatility, Rates, Funding, Fiscal, Commodities, Housing, Monetary, USD, Crypto
- **Unified State Builder**: Single `lox labs unified` command shows all regimes with scores
- **ML Feature Extraction**: Export flat feature vectors with `--json` for model training

**Leading Indicator Adjustments (Edge Enhancement)**
- **7 Warning Signals**: Yield curve inversion, VIX elevated/complacent, credit widening, funding stress, rates shock
- **Probability Adjustments**: Signals adjust transition probabilities (e.g., inverted curve → risk-off prob ×1.8)
- **Research-Backed**: Each indicator sourced from academic research (Estrella & Mishkin, CBOE, Gilchrist & Zakrajsek)
- **Transparent**: Active signals displayed in `lox labs transitions` output

**Regime Transition Probabilities**

**New Commands**
```bash
lox labs unified              # View all 10 regimes with scores
lox labs unified --json       # Export ML features
lox labs transitions          # Transition matrix with signal adjustments

## Strategy

### Mandate
Discretionary macro portfolio management with systematic research support. Primary focus on tail-risk hedging with positive carry during calm periods.

### Thesis
- Persistent inflation risk above 2010s baseline
- Rising macro volatility from fiscal/rates dynamics
- Structural shift in Treasury issuance → higher vol premium
- Regime awareness improves timing and sizing

### Implementation
- **Long convexity**: OTM puts on SPY/QQQ, VIX calls
- **Delta management**: Adjust exposures based on regime signals
- **Carry optimization**: Time spreads and premium selling in favorable regimes
- **Cross-asset**: Sector rotation based on rate/vol/growth implications

### Risk Limits
| Metric | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Max position size | 15% NAV |
| Max portfolio delta | ±30% |
| Max theta decay | 2% NAV/month |
| VaR 95% (3M) | <10% |

---

## Data Sources

| Source | Data |
|--------|------|
| **FRED** | Macro time series (rates, employment, inflation) |
