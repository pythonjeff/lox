## Investment Process

### 1. Morning Dashboard Review
Every morning begins with the **live web dashboard** for real-time portfolio and macro context:

**Web Dashboard** (Primary):
- Open browser to dashboard URL
- Review Palmer's regime analysis and traffic lights
- Check Monte Carlo 6-month forecast
- Review position-level theories and P&L attribution

**CLI Research** (Deep Dive):
```bash
lox status                   # Portfolio health
lox dashboard                # All regimes at a glance
lox regime vol --llm         # Volatility with LLM analysis
```

### 2. Deep Research
Before any trade, I conduct multi-source analysis:

**Ticker-Level Research**:
```bash
lox research -t NVDA              # Deep ticker research
lox research -t AAPL --llm        # With LLM analysis
lox chat -t FXI                   # Interactive discussion
```

**Regime Research**:
```bash
lox regime vol                    # Volatility regime
lox regime fiscal                 # Fiscal (deficits, TGA)
lox regime rates                  # Rates/curve analysis
lox regime macro                  # Macro overview
```

### 3. Options Scanning
Find options for trade ideas:

```bash
lox scan -t NVDA --want put       # Options chain (30-365 DTE default)
lox scan -t CRWV --min-days 100   # Long-dated options
lox options best NVDA --budget 500  # Best under budget
```

### 4. Risk Analysis
Before execution, stress-test the portfolio:

```bash
lox scenario monte-carlo          # Monte Carlo simulation
lox scenario stress               # Stress testing
lox analyze --depth deep          # Full position analysis
```

### 5. Execution Decision
After completing research, I make the final call:
- Size based on conviction and portfolio impact
- Entry triggers based on technical/catalyst timing
- Stops and targets informed by scenario analysis

**No trade is executed without completing this workflow.**

### Deep Ticker Research (January 2026) — Primary Trade Research Driver

The `lox labs ticker deep` command has evolved into our **primary research tool** for individual securities. It provides institutional-grade analysis with asset-type awareness, distinguishing between ETFs and individual stocks.

**Asset-Type Aware Analysis**
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies ETFs by holdings data, company name patterns (iShares, Vanguard, SPDR, etc.)
- **Tailored Metrics**: Shows relevant data for each asset type — no earnings analysis for ETFs, no fund flows for stocks
- **Context-Aware LLM**: Prompts adapt to provide fund thesis for ETFs, earnings preview for stocks

**ETF Analysis Features**
```bash
lox labs ticker deep -t FXI --llm    # China large-cap ETF
lox labs ticker deep -t TIP --llm    # TIPS bond ETF
```
- **Fund Profile**: AUM, expense ratio, holdings count, category
- **Top Holdings**: Asset breakdown with weights (uses `name` fallback for bond holdings)
- **Performance & Flows**: 1W, 1M, 3M, YTD returns + fund flow signals (volume trend proxy for inflows/outflows)
- **Institutional Holders**: Top 10 investors with share counts and position changes (who's buying/selling)
- **LLM Analysis**: Fund thesis, holdings concentration, risk factors, market environment fit

**Stock Analysis Features**
```bash
lox labs ticker deep -t AAPL --llm   # Individual stock
lox labs ticker deep -t NVDA --llm   # Growth stock
```
- **Company Profile**: Sector, industry, market cap, description
- **Price & Technicals**: Current price, day/52-week ranges, volume analysis
- **Hedge Fund Metrics**: P/E, P/S, P/B, EV/EBITDA, ROE, ROIC, margins, FCF yield
- **Earnings & Estimates**: Next earnings date, analyst EPS/revenue estimates, historical beat rate
- **SEC Filings**: Recent 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q with items/descriptions
- **Analyst Targets**: Consensus, low, high price targets with analyst count
- **LLM Analysis**: Bull/bear case, earnings preview, near-term catalysts

**Interactive Ticker Chat**
```bash
lox chat -t AAPL    # Chat with AAPL context loaded
lox chat -t FXI     # Discuss China ETF with full research context
```
Loads deep research data (profile, earnings, news, SEC filings) into chat for focused ticker discussions.

**Example Output: ETF Institutional Holders**
```
                     Top Institutional Holders

## Strategy

### Mandate
Discretionary macro portfolio management with systematic research support. Primary focus on tail-risk hedging with positive carry during calm periods.

### Thesis
- Persistent inflation risk above 2010s baseline
- Rising macro volatility from fiscal/rates dynamics
- Structural shift in Treasury issuance → higher vol premium
- Regime awareness improves timing and sizing

### Implementation
- **Long convexity**: OTM puts on SPY/QQQ, VIX calls
- **Delta management**: Adjust exposures based on regime signals
- **Carry optimization**: Time spreads and premium selling in favorable regimes
- **Cross-asset**: Sector rotation based on rate/vol/growth implications

### Risk Limits
| Metric | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Max position size | 15% NAV |
| Max portfolio delta | ±30% |
| Max theta decay | 2% NAV/month |
| VaR 95% (3M) | <10% |

---

## Data Sources

| Source | Data |
|--------|------|
| **FRED** | Macro time series (rates, employment, inflation) |
| **Alpaca** | Real-time quotes, positions, news with full content |
