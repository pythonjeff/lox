Funding-stack cross-correlations.

Surfaces which lever is currently driving funding pressure by computing rolling
correlations between rates (SOFR-IORB corridor, SOFR-EFFR basis) and plumbing
(reserves, RRP, TGA, WALCL, T-bills, net liquidity). The edge is:

  1. Pair correlations vs a 3-year baseline tell you which mechanism is
     currently *active* — e.g., SOFR-IORB ↔ Reserves at -0.65 (vs -0.40
     baseline) means reserves are now the dominant driver of corridor stress.

  2. Divergences flag regime breaks: when ON RRP normally buffers funding
     (strong negative corr with SOFR-IORB) but the correlation weakens toward
     zero, the cushion is broken — that's a regime shift before it shows up in
     levels.

  3. Lead-lag tells you what's a leading indicator: ΔTGA typically leads
     SOFR-IORB by 5-10 days. If today's TGA flow is large and the lagged
     correlation is strong negative, funding stress is queued.

Data alignment: weekly H.4.1 series (WRESBAL, WALCL, WSHOBL) are forward-filled
to a business-day grid so daily rolling correlations have observations on every
date. Change-based pairs use 5-day diffs so Wed-to-Wed weekly prints align
naturally without ffill artifacts.
