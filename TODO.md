# TODOs (manual follow-up)

- [ ] Run `git filter-repo` or BFG to purge `Investor list.xlsx` from git history
- [ ] Audit git history for any accidentally committed `.env` files or API keys
- [ ] Review test coverage — ensure regime classification, Monte Carlo, NAV calcs, and trade logic are tested
- [ ] Decide on a license and add LICENSE file
- [ ] Remove performance metrics from any public-facing docs (keep on loxfund.com dashboard only)
